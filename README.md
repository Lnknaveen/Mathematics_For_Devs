## Developers needs to keep calm when you hear mathematics :)

### Most important discrete mathematics

- Infiniate iteration from Continues set to discrete sets.
  - E.g., Circle : Infinite number of points equidistant from the fixed point.
  - Polygons stating from trangle and increse the number of vertices eventually approximate to circle.  
- **Sets**
  - A set is a well-defined collection of distinct objects.
  - Elements can be anything (Numbers, Letters, variables, more sets or nothing)
  - Are denoted by capital letters
  - ∈ element of
  - E.g., 
    - A = { 1, 2 } or 1 ∈ A
    - B = { a, b, c }
    - C = { }
    - D = { A, B, C }
    - E = { { 1 }, { a, b, c}, { A, B, C } }
- **Interval notation and Common sets**
  - x ∈ ( 0, 1 ) **or** x is an element of interval 0 and 1 **or** 0 < x < 1
  - x ∈ [ 0, 1 ) **or** 0 <= x < 1
  - x ∈ [ 0, 1 ] **or** 0 <= x <= 1
  - ∅ = {} empty set
  - N = { 1, 2, 3, ... } Natural numbers
  - N<sub>0</sub> = { 0, 1, 2, 3, ... } Natural numbers with zero
  - Z = { ..., -1, 0, 1, ... } All numbers
- **What is a Rational Number?**
  - A ratio of two integers
  - 10x = 9.999..., x = 0.999..., 10x - x = 9x = 9, x = 1, 10x = 10  **are rational numbers**.
  - 2.78 = y, 278 / 100 = y **are rational numbers**.
  - Q = { a / b : a, b ∈ Z, b != 0 }
- **Sets: Non-Rational Number**
  - √2 = a / b, 2 = a<sup>2</sup> / b<sup>2</sup> = 2b<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup>, **a is even**.
    - a<sup>2</sup> = 2 ( 2K<sup>2</sup> ), a.a = (2k).(2k), a = 2k
      - 2b<sup>2</sup> = 2(2K<sup>2</sup>), b<sup>2</sup> = 2K<sup>2</sup>, **b is even**.
        - √2 = a / b, √2 = 2k / 2l = √2 = k / l, **No more rational number** So we need set Operators.
- **Set operators**
